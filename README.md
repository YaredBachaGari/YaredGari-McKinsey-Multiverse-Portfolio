  Within this repository, you will discover a compilation of projects that exemplify my skills on the design and implementation of web applications, while following all software life cycle phases. These projects reflect my progress throughout a 15-month apprenticeship with Multiverse as well as Mckinsey & Company between 2022 and 2023. Furthermore, I have also included a selected personal projects for showcase. When you open each projects you will find a brief about the project,features, technologies i used, skill competencies and instructions to run the project on your machine.

## üóíÔ∏è Overview of Apprenticeship

- Apprentice Name: Yared Gari
- Hosting Company:McKinsey & Company
- Duration: 15 Months
- Github: https://github.com/YaredBachaGari
- Website : https://yaredgari-portfolio.vercel.app/projects

## üëã Introduction:

Hello, my name is Yared Gari, and I am currently working as a software engineering apprentice at McKinsey & Company and Multiverse. I have always enjoyed working with computers and solving problems, which is why I chose to pursue a career in software engineering. I find the daily challenges that software engineers face to be exciting, and I am always eager to tackle new problems. I am particularly fascinated by data-driven intelligent applications and their ability to simplify human life.

During my apprenticeship at Multiverse between 2022-2023, I completed my full-stack software career path training and worked on various collaborative and individual projects. I also had the opportunity to apply what I learned to real-world projects at McKinsey & Company. I contributed to the development of recently released products such as the McKinsey Quarterly digital and McKinsey Insight Stores web applications, which added thousands of new users to our user base within the first three months. In this portfolio, given the nature of proprietary product and code information, I am unable to share specific details about these projects publicly. Instead, I will focus on my contributions and learning experiences from group and personal projects.

Throughout this period, I learned every step of the software development process, from requirement analysis to design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and agile ceremonies. Moreover, I acquired valuable skills such as collaboration with team members, working in a fast-paced environment, meeting deadlines and expectations, and proactively communicating with team members. Currently, I am exploring advanced best practices, architectures, and performance optimization, integrating applications with Open AI API and other cutting-edge technologies to build scalable, reliable, and maintainable applications.

## üôèüèΩ Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Multiverse for their excellent teaching curriculum and continued guidance and support throughout my apprenticeship period. Their efforts have truly helped me shift from a beginner to a confident developer, and I am grateful for the opportunities they provided me.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to McKinsey & Company and my team for the unique opportunity they gave me to contribute to real-world problems and to further my learning. The senior developers in my team were incredibly supportive, which made my learning curve smoother and shorter. I cannot thank the firm and my team enough for their support and belief in me.

Finally, I would like to give a special thanks to my coach, Linda Eng from Multiverse, and my supervisor, Azam Jameel from McKinsey & Company. Their guidance and feedback have been invaluable to my growth and development as a software developer.
