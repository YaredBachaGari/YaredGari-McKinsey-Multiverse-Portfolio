  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
  Within this repository, you will discover a compilation of projects that exemplify my skills on the design and implementation of web applications, while following all software life cycle phases. These projects reflect my progress throughout a 15-month apprenticeship with Multiverse, in addition to my contributions as a full-stack developer at McKinsey & Company between 2022 and 2023. Furthermore, I have included a selected personal software development projects for demonstration purpose.Please note that going forward, I will use "the firm" instead of "McKinsey & Company" to shorten the name.

<!-- Overview -->

## üóíÔ∏è Overview

During my apprenticeship at McKinsey & Company, I was able to contribute directly to the development and release of new features, such as McKinsey Quarterly and McKinsey Insights Store. I also collaborated on improving and adding functionalities to the existing McKinsey.com code base. However, due to proprietary product and code information being confidential, it would be overwhelming and against firm policy to share specific details publicly. Instead, I will highlight my contributions to McKinsey & Company in general and showcase the skillset, technology stacks, and software development life cycle methodology that I have learned and applied to both my Multiverse apprenticeship and personal projects.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Durable Skills

As we all know, durable and soft skills are essential components for software development. They help to speed up the development process, understand the requirements, create a common goal among team members, and deliver high-quality services and products to users or clients. To showcase the skills I have acquired during my journey, I have created a separate directory within this repository called "Durable Skills" with its own descriptive ReadMe file. This directory outlines my contributions and learnings at both Multiverse and the firm.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills

Similar to the Durable Skills directory, I have also created a separate directory called "Technical Skills" with its own ReadMe file. Under this section, I have outlined and presented projects that I created during my training at Multiverse and my personal projects separately. Each project demonstrates different phases of the software development life cycle, architectural decisions, and technology choices with examples. For more information, please refer to the Technical Skills directory.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Multiverse for their excellent teaching curriculum and continued guidance and support throughout my apprenticeship period. Their efforts have truly helped me shift from a beginner to a confident developer, and I am grateful for the opportunities they provided me.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to McKinsey & Company and my team for the unique opportunity they gave me to contribute to real-world problems and to further my learning. The senior developers in my team were incredibly supportive, which made my learning curve smoother and shorter. I cannot thank the firm and my team enough for their support and belief in me.

Finally, I would like to give a special thanks to my coach, Linda Eng from Multiverse, and my supervisor, Azam Jameel from McKinsey & Company. Their guidance and feedback have been invaluable to my growth and development as a software developer.
