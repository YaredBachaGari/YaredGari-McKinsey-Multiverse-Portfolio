## Introduction:

My name is Yared Gari. Currently I am  a software engineering apprentice at McKinsey & Company | Multiverse. I chose software engineering because I have always loved working with computers and solving problems. The problems a software engineer faces day to day are exciting to me and I look forward to new ones every day. I am always facinated by data driven intelligent application and their power to make huma life easier. 

In the past 15months of my apprenticeship with Multiverse between 2022- 2023, i have successfully completed my fullstack software career path training and worked on many collaborative projects with other apparenctices as well as individual projects. In parallel, i had a chance to apply what i have learned on real world projects at Mckinsey & Company. I have also contributed on recently released products such as Mckinsey Quarterly digital and Mckinsey Insight Stores web apps which added thousands of new users to our user base in the first three months. During this period, I have learned every single steps starting from requirement analysis to all the way to design, development, testing, deployment, maintainance and agile ceremonies. Most importantly, i acquired durable skills such as collaborating with team, working in a fast paced environment, meeting deadlines and expectations, and proactively communicating with team members. Now, i am exploring a more advanced best practices, architectures and performance optimization, integrating applications with Open AI API and cutting edge technologies in the software engineering field.


## PROJECT OR ACCOMPLISHMENT 1

My first accomplishment at the firm was a “read more” component and a randomization feature that was added to our shared component library at the firm.

The read more component gave the end user a smoother experience and allowed the developer to put in custom amounts of text to be shown before the button is pressed. This allowed us to take even more control over our design and yielded a better product.

The randomization feature allowed us to combat screen placement bias and gave us better data from our testing tool.

During my time on this team, I was introduced to the Agile workflow which was an improvement for me over the waterfall method that was used at my last job. My time on the Explorers team was very informative and kicked off my journey to becoming a software engineer at The Firm.

  Competencies

JF 1.6
Shows curiosity to the business context in which the solution will be used, displaying an inquisitive approach to solving the problem. This includes the curiosity to explore new opportunities, and techniques; the tenacity to improve methods and maximize performance of the solution; and creativity in their approach to solutions.

During my time on this team, the two solutions I came up with were ones that I suggested. I used my creativity to come up with solutions that were out of the box enough to fix our problem and be added to our reusable codebase.

JF 1.7
Demonstrates creativity and tenacity in their approach to solutions and the methods used to come to a solution for example, sees the task through to the end by devising new solutions and despite obstacles and problems along the way.

When proposing my solutions on this team, I had to stand my ground for my solutions because at the time it was questioned if an apprentice engineer should be given these tasks solo. I was able to pitch my solutions and follow them into production.

## PROJECT OR ACCOMPLISHMENT 2

Certifications for Secure Product Development Lifecycle and Github Cloud Practitioner, completed classes in React, Spring, and Java fundamentals.

During my time at McKinsey, I was able to receive lots of education from firm provided education services. I was even able to acquire 2 firm approved certifications that allow me to work on the teams that I am on.

  Personal Projects from start to finish

In my portfolio, I have several working projects that I have been able to see through from start to finish. This is a grand accomplishment for me as it shows I have a basic understanding of an entire stack. Being an aspiring full-fledged full-stack software engineer, I need all the practice I can get taking an idea into reality.

## PROJECT OR ACCOMPLISHMENT 3

Contributions to the Engagement Feedback Team at McKinsey & Co.

My most recent assignment has been to the wonderful Engagement Feedback team. I have learned a lot about agile methodologies and also about how each of my different team member’s roles function. I have done some design work, some QA, frontend development, backend development, created new endpoints, I could go on. I have gained such a variety of learning experiences that I feel like this team was where the bulk of my learning has been.

The most significant assignment on the frontend I have accomplished is a total redesign of our survey. I helped my team add new fluid components that are more enjoyable for users and make the questions less confusing. It also reduced the survey length drastically making it feel shorter for the user.

On the backend, I was able to make some real structure changes around our email notification service which allowed for a more “clean-architecture” approach. This allows us to set when we want (and don’t want) emails to be sent out and I am currently developing a developer portal that can be used to toggle some simple things in our dev environments.

All my contributions have mostly been overseen by senior developers who give me great advice and tips along the way. I even get to drive development around 50% of the time, which means I am the one making commits to the codebase.

I have been able to do multiple presentations to stakeholders and to other firm members while on this team. After each presentation, I am constantly asking for feedback and acting upon what I have learned. Throughout my presentations, I have received feedback from my colleagues that my presentation skills have drastically improved.

Overall, my current assignment has been my favorite job position I have ever had. I am excited about continuing on with this team into the new year and I can’t wait for what in store for me to learn next.
